# Data-Analysis---Image-classification-model
The project builds a binary image classifier using ResNet-18 on the Kaggle Cats vs. Dogs dataset. Tasks include data pre-processing, fine-tuning ResNet-18, training, and evaluating with accuracy and loss metrics. The code is clean, documented, and ready for improvements like data augmentation or advanced techniques.
