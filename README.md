# Data-Analysis---Image-classification-model

Problem Definition

Objective:
The objective of this project is to build an image classification model that can distinguish between two categories: cats and dogs. The model will classify images into either the 'Cat' or 'Dog' category based on the visual features present in the images. This task is often used in the domain of computer vision and has real-world applications such as automated image tagging, content filtering, and object detection in digital media.

Dataset:
For this task, I will use the Kaggle Cat vs. Dog dataset, which contains a large number of images labeled as either "Cat" or "Dog". The dataset is well-suited for binary image classification, making it ideal for testing our model’s accuracy and performance.

Dataset Size:
The dataset consists of a total of 25,000 images of cats and dogs, evenly split between the two classes. We will preprocess and split the dataset into three parts:
- Training set: 80% of the data
- Validation set: 10% of the data
- Test set: 10% of the data

 Model Selection and Implementation

Model Architecture:
For this classification task, we will use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), with ResNet-18, a pre-trained deep learning model, adapted for binary classification. The ResNet-18 architecture is a powerful neural network model with residual connections that help prevent the vanishing gradient problem in deep networks.

- Transfer Learning: We will fine-tune the pre-trained ResNet-18 model. This involves reusing the feature extractor layers of ResNet-18 and modifying the final classification layer to output two classes: 'Cat' and 'Dog'. By leveraging the pre-trained model, we benefit from the feature representations learned from large datasets like ImageNet.

Key Modifications:
- Replaced the final fully connected layer to output 2 classes (Cat, Dog) instead of the original ImageNet classes.

 Training and Evaluation

Training Process:
The model will be trained using the **cross-entropy loss** function, a common loss function for classification tasks. The optimizer used will be **Adam**, which adapts the learning rate during training to improve convergence. The model will be trained for 5 epochs with a batch size of 32.

Metrics:
The model's performance will be evaluated using **accuracy**—the percentage of correct predictions. Additionally, we will also monitor the loss during training and validation to identify overfitting or underfitting issues. Evaluation will also involve testing on a separate test set to estimate how well the model generalizes to unseen data.

Code Quality and Documentation

Code Structure:
- Clean and Modular: The code is organized into distinct steps, including data loading, cleaning, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. Each step is clearly separated to maintain clarity and reduce complexity.
- Comments and Documentation: Each significant section of the code is commented, and relevant functions are defined to improve readability. The steps taken in the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation are explained to ensure the code is understandable.

Functions and Methods:
1. Data Preprocessing: I clean the dataset by removing corrupted image files and applying transformations like resizing and normalization.
2. Model Training: The model is trained with a focus on accuracy, and validation loss is also tracked to monitor for overfitting.
3. Visualization: Predictions are visualized to provide insights into the model’s performance.

Summary

In summary, the project involves building a binary image classification model using ResNet-18. The model is trained on the Kaggle Cats vs. Dogs dataset, and the main objective is to classify images as either 'Cat' or 'Dog'. The implementation involves pre-processing the dataset, fine-tuning a pre-trained ResNet-18 model, training it, and evaluating it using accuracy and loss metrics. The code is organized, documented, and ready for further improvements, such as adding data augmentation or exploring more advanced techniques.
